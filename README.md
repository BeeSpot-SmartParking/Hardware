# 🐝 BeeSpot – Smart Parking Management System



## Description
<div style="text-align: justify">

**BeeSpot** is a **smart parking management system** designed to tackle traffic congestion and inefficient parking in cities like Algiers.  

The system combines **IoT sensors** (ultrasonic, cameras, smart meters) with **ESP32 microcontrollers** to detect car presence, monitor occupancy, and connect to a central platform.  
Data is sent securely to the cloud, where it is visualized and made available to:

- **Drivers** → instantly find, reserve, and pay for parking.  
- **Municipalities** → access dashboards with real-time usage stats, alerts, and revenue tracking.  
- **Private Parking Owners** → digitize parking management and monetize available spaces.  

<br>

The backend also integrates a **database and analytics engine** for predicting demand, identifying anomalies, and enabling smarter urban mobility.
