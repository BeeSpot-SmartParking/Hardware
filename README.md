Description
<div style="text-align: justify"> ParkMate is a **smart parking management system** designed to tackle traffic congestion and inefficient parking in cities like Algiers.

The system combines IoT sensors (ultrasonic, cameras, smart meters) with ESP32 microcontrollers to detect car presence, monitor occupancy, and connect to a central platform. Data is sent securely to the cloud, where it is visualized and made available to:

Drivers → who can instantly find, reserve, and pay for parking.

Municipalities → who access dashboards with real-time usage stats, alerts, and revenue tracking.

Private Parking Owners → who can digitize their parking management and monetize available spaces.

<br>

The backend also integrates a database and analytics engine for predicting demand, identifying anomalies, and enabling smarter urban mobility.
